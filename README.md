# home_controller

This is planned to controll my ikea tradfri lights and musik from onkyo receiver plus all the other stuff I built (water the plants, make photos, ...)

Planned hardware features:
* RFID/nfc to start specific playlists
* some LEDs/Buttons to controll and monitor state
* touchscreen to extend/replace led/button controll (to monitor state and select musik)
* volume controll with Rotary Encoder
